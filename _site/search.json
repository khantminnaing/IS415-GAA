Hence, before analysing, I extract the necessary data sets from the following sources:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg\nPre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg\nCycling Path from LTADataMall\nLatest version of Singapore Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb\n\n\n\n2.2 Installing R-Packages\nIn this exercise, I will be using two R packages will be used. They are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data, and\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\nTidyverse consists of a family of R packages. In this hands-on exercise, the following packages will be used:\n\nreadr for importing csv data,\nreadxl for importing Excel worksheet,\ntidyr for manipulating data,\ndplyr for transforming data, and\nggplot2 for visualising data\n\nI install the required packages using the code chunk below.\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)"
